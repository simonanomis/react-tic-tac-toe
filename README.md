## Immutability
1. Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement.
Avoiding direct data mutation lets us keep previous versions of the gameâ€™s history intact, and reuse them later.
2. Detecting changes in mutable objects is difficult because they are modified directly. 
3. It helps you build pure components in React
